# wireguard-multihop
This repository contains my wireguard config for setting up a multihop VPN.  
I use an OCI-VPS (Ubuntu) as first hop.  
From there the connection is redirected to my OPNsense and I can use my selfhosted services.


Client: The device you want to connect/to use.

OCI = Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (I use the free tier).
